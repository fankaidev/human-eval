Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   -  `largest_factor = 1`: We start with `largest_factor` as 1, assuming the largest factor is at least 1.\n   - `i = 2`: We initialize a counter `i` to 2, as 2 is the smallest prime number.\n\n2. **Iterative Prime Factor Search:**\n   - `while i * i <= n:`: This loop continues as long as the square of `i` is less than or equal to `n`. This optimization is based on the fact that if `n` has a prime factor greater than its square root, it must also have a corresponding prime factor smaller than its square root.\n     -  `if n % i == 0:`: If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means `i` is a prime factor of `n`.\n       - `largest_factor = i`: We update `largest_factor` to `i` since we found a new potentially larger prime factor.\n       - `n //= i`: We divide `n` by `i` to remove this prime factor from `n`. \n     - `else:`: If `n` is not divisible by `i`, we move on to the next potential prime factor.\n       - `i += 1`: We increment `i` to check the next integer.\n\n3. **Final Check:**\n   - `if n > largest_factor:`: After the loop, `n` might still be greater than 1. This means that the remaining value of `n` is itself a prime factor larger than any we've found so far.\n     - `largest_factor = n`:  We update `largest_factor` to be the remaining value of `n`.\n\n4. **Return Value:**\n   - `return largest_factor`: The function returns the `largest_factor` found.\n\n\n\n   \n\nLet me know if you have any other Python functions you'd like help completing!"}
